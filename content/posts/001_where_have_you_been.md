I wrote a [long post](/about) about why I would like to start this blog around seven months ago and from then on, I didn't post anything.. What I found out during this time is that it is really hard to start writing about something! What exactly is hard I don't exactly know! But I have some guesses. It might be hard to find something meaningful or worth sharing, or it might be hard to be incentivized enough to start writing. Or maybe a combination of both!

When I track my feelings I had when I started this blog, it all started with a revolutionary thought that what I am used to in my life, is not satisfactory for me. I sensed that I need to improve my way of thinking. I sensed that I cannot explain what is happening around me with what I know. So I felt I need to dive deeper in my thoughts, hence writing about them and try to organize the ideas in my head. However, I didn't know what to write about, where to start and how to manage this organization of ideas although I was contemplating about them constantly. Today I am writing again and the reason is another event that pushed me to do so. This time not in my head. But externally!

I am from Iran, a country in middle east, also known as Persia. Since my childhood, I was living under the shadow of a totalitarian regime. But that is not all about this land! Iran was a cradle for civilizations since five thousand years ago, one of the oldest in the world. It was home to various dynasties and kings, some benevolent, some vicious. The land experienced glory as well as misery, pride as well as humiliation and freedom as well as oppression in its time. This cycle went on and on for thousands of years and now in the modern times, we are living in a desperate time. Like of which I'm not sure happened before.

You see, there is something unique about learning the history of a country and that is, in a very short time, like an hour in your lifetime, you can read about the summary of events of hundreds of years in the past. Yet, you yourself, only live 70 years in average. So the events you witness in your lifetime, can be summarized in less than an hour read for the next generations. This extremely unmatched proportion of time, makes it way too hard to identify the patterns you see in history and apply them to the current events. Of-course, things can become more clear if you spend more time and read more about the details of the past events, analyze them carefully, adjust your mindset and judge the narratives. This is what historians do who are specialized in this and indeed, the summary that we read are the result of those people's hard work. But talking about me, as a person not specialized and not willing to spend my whole life, reading about history. The practical way of "learning" history for me is to read the summary of events and trust the source that it is what happened. Hence I'll for sure lose a lot of context and insight about how they happened and how related those are to the current situation we are living in.

I am sure I am not alone with that kind of learning about history. In fact, the majority of people do not event read that summary! So what is practical in this situation? What is the underlying mechanism of people learning about history? Well, I think it is the same mechanism that was sculpting the human behavior since the beginning of them apes: we pass it on as a story!

There is a reason why we all like stories. Stories are designed to bombard you with interesting stuff, they maintain a good pace about narrating the ongoing events, they won't let you get bored. We are evolved to like them, to feel excited about them as they are more interesting than sitting around spending your time looking at the boring uneventful nature. We, after all, are capable of abstract thinking and we gained so much out of it. So as eating gives you pleasure because you need it to develop your body and sex is fun because it allows you to reproduce, stories are fun because it helps practicing your abstract thinking by "imagining" those tales to be true.

No always the stories have to be lies, in fact, stories can play major roles in passing on the truth. Of-course, this medium will likely be falsified after some narrations just because you want a story to be more interesting and engaging. But still, this is the form we are used to, and this is the widely accepted instrument, people are willing to spend time on. When we hear the tale of a warrior or a king or a revolution, it is engaging, adventurous, and fun. So let's dig in to the tale of Iran, what people pass down by word of mouth.
